# Best Practices for Topic Modeling
## by Micah D. Saxton

## About
This project builds, tests, and analyses a number of different topic models based on the *Journal of Biblical Literature* in order to make recommendations to the non-expert on how a useful topic model should be built. It is submitted to the faculty of the Library and Information Science Program at the University of Denver in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Library and Information Science.
